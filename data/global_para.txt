# ------- the parameters in kNN_MOF_cp algorithm ---------
# number of the rain stations
N_STATION,134

# T_CP == TRUE: the disaggregation algorithm conditioned on circulation patterns
# otherwise, on seasonality (12 months) only
T_CP,TRUE

# SEASON: only valid when T_CP == TRUE; meaning that the disaggregation is conditioned both
# on cp and seasonality (two seasons: summer and winter)
# summer: from May to October (5-10)
# winter: from November to next April (11-4)
SEASON,TRUE

# the CONTINUITY in candidates filtering; 1 or 3
CONTINUITY,1

# the flexibility level of wet-dry status in candidates filtering
# WD:0 very strict, only the candidates with exact the same wet-dry status of target day can be selected
# WD:1 flexible, the candidates with same wet-dry status covering that of target day will be selected
